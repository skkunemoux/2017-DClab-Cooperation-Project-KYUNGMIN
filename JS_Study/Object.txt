//'Object' in javascript is similar to 'dictionary' in Python or 'HashMap' in JAVA.

#1 
//how to declare and initialize object?

1)
var grades = {'height': 178, 'weight': 71}; 
//object is similar to array. It can have word or numbers as an index(key). However, it has no order.

2)
var grades = {};
grades['kyung'] = 10;
grades['min'] = 6;

grades.kyung // result: 10
grades.min // result: 6

3)
var grades = new Object();
grades['kyung'] = 10;
grades['min'] = 6;

#2
//Iteration with object
//Similar to 'advanced for loop'in JAVA.
var grades={'kyung':10, 'min':20}

for(key in grades){
  	console.log(key);   //kyung 
}                       //min


#3 
//object can contain the object again, and also can contain functions.

  var object={                            //new object
      'list':{'kyung':178, 'min':71},     //first element contains new object
      'show': function(){                 //second contains function
        for(var name in this.list){       //'this' indicates the object including this code. Same with JAVA.
          document.write(name+"<br />");  
        }
      }
    };

  object.show();  //kyung
                  //min
